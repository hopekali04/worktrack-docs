## Project Philosophy

### Mobile-First Design
Every feature is designed and tested on mobile devices first, then progressively enhanced for larger screens. This ensures the app works perfectly where users need it most - at the gym.

### Type Safety
Strict TypeScript combined with Zod validation provides type safety from the UI layer through to the database. This catches bugs before they reach production and makes refactoring safe.

### Performance
The app uses SWR for intelligent caching and request deduplication, skeleton screens for perceived performance, and code splitting to minimize initial load times.

### Accessibility
Built with semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. All interactive elements are focusable and have appropriate labels.

### Developer Experience
Clean code organization, comprehensive TypeScript types, and consistent naming conventions make the codebase easy to understand and maintain.
